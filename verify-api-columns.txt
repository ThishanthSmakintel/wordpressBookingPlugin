=== CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND ===

The availability check is filtering by:
  status IN ('confirmed', 'created')

But the database only has these statuses:
  - 'confirmed' (exists in data)
  - 'cancelled' (exists in data)
  - 'pending' (default value)

The status 'created' does NOT exist in the database!

This means appointments with status='confirmed' ARE being returned correctly.
The empty response means there are NO appointments matching:
  - The specific date being queried
  - The specific employee_id being queried
  - With status='confirmed' or 'created'

=== SOLUTION ===

The API is working correctly. The empty unavailable[] response means:
  ✓ No appointments exist for that date/employee combination
  ✓ All time slots are available
  ✓ This is the CORRECT behavior

To verify, check what date/employee you're querying:
  - Current appointments are for dates: 2025-10-23, 2025-10-24, 2025-10-27, 2025-11-03
  - Current employees: 1 (Sarah Johnson), 2 (Mike Wilson)
  - Only 'confirmed' status appointments will block slots
