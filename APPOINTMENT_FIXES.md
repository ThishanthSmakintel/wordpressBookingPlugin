# Appointment Loading and Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 404 Error on `/appointments/stream` Endpoint
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to call a non-working stream endpoint, causing 404 errors.
**Solution**: Updated frontend to use the existing `/user-appointments` endpoint instead.

### 2. New Appointment Button Styling
**Problem**: Button had incorrect HTML structure and missing styling.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed JSX className attributes
- Added proper CSS styling with gradient background and hover effects
- Added Font Awesome plus icon

### 3. API Endpoints Initialization
**Problem**: Duplicate REST API route registrations causing conflicts.
**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate routes from main plugin class
- Fixed API endpoints initialization timing
- Ensured proper WordPress hooks

### 4. Real-time Data Loading

- Updated `loadUserAppointmentsRealtime()` function to use working endpoint
